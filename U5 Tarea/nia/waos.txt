Esta rola me dejo mal

I picked you up from the corner store
Your eyes were red and your lips were torn
So much to say that's subject-sore
So much you'd change since you were born
You wrapped your fingers around my neck
And pulled me into your desperate breath
The way you kissed me hot and fast
I knew it'd be the last
Don't leave me hangin' alone again
Don't leave me hangin' alone again
Oh, where'd you go, go, Alley Rose?
Oh, where'd you go, go, go?
You told me, "I'm just so nervous, dear"
Well, how the hell do you think I feel?
I waited all year at your feet
Like maybe you'd love me
So
Don't leave me hangin' alone again
Don't leave me hangin' alone again
Oh, where'd you go, go, Alley Rose?
Oh, where'd you go, go, go?
And I don't even care
If it makes me sound insane
I ran my fingers through your hair
And I thanked God to touch the flame
'Cause I swore necks were made for bruisin'
I swore lips were made for lies
And I thought if you'd ever leave me
That I'd be the reason why
And I don't even care
If it's just a summer fling
If it's all experimental
And you go back to safer things
But I swore hands were made for fighting
I swore eyes were made to cry
But you're the first person that I've seen
Who's proven that might be a lie
So
Don't leave me hangin' alone again
Don't leave me hangin'
Oh, where'd you go, go, Alley Rose?
Oh, where'd you go, go, go?
Oh
Don't leave me hangin' alone again
Don't leave me hangin' alone again
Oh, where'd you go, go, Alley Rose?
Oh, where'd you go, go, go?
Don't leave me hangin' alone again
I thought that I was your only friend
Oh, where'd you go, go, Alley Rose?
Oh, where'd you go, go, go?
